#### Summary:
This app picks 3 food dishes for the user with a click of a button. Food can be specified by a category, and results include a recipe as well as a how-to-make video.

#### Motivation:
One of the most frequently asked questions is: "What should we eat?"
Far too much time is wasted on trying to answer this question, so I decided to make an app to speed up the process.
